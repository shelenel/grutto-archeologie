[{"content":"In archaeological contexts, predictive modeling attempts to predict the locations of archaeological sites in landscapes based on previously conducted surveys, often relying on environmental and ecological characteristics to understand the probability behind settlement placement. Predictive models are therefore useful in the context of CRM, such as in the case of the Netherlands, where the predicting concentrations of archaeological remains is important for construction and damage prevention.\nBefore being able to work on a predictive model, it is important to first understand how to operate the necessary software required for it, which in our case was QGIS. By manipulating and analysing various maps of the research area in QGIS, we were better able to understand the land use of the research area and how we could continue to develop a well-suited model for it.\nMaps The first basic step we had to do was to import maps. There were several types of maps we had to use such as vector, satellite imagery, elevation model (AHN), paleogeographical and geomorphological maps (And even more maps to come in weeks!) Choosing what maps to use is highly dependent on the project objective and often, multiple maps are stacked as layers to encompass a comprehensive understanding of the research area.\nUnderstanding land use Basic vector maps are able to show and categorise how parts of land were used.\nBefore and after using a clear coloured symbology to categorise land use. Choosing appropriate colours such as green for parks and blue for water sources can help direct the audience to locate significant land usage patterns. Within our research area, it is clear that there is a large forest/bos (in brown) and a Rhine river channel (middle, in blue) which can be helpful in predicting archaeology.\nAdditional note on metadata:\nAlthough often we work with pre-made maps given by an organisation/online provider, it is important to assess and be critical about the quality of the data provided.\nIn our case, the given maps (D39G and D39E) contained relatively confusing categories of land usage. An example of this is \u0026lsquo;Verblijfsrecreatie\u0026rsquo; which although translated to roughly \u0026lsquo;residential recreation\u0026rsquo; in English, it can be difficult or confusing to understand the function without giving concrete examples (e.g. camping sites? Swimming pools?). It was difficult having to narrow down the 25 categories to broader 8 main categories when original given categories were not defined well. This can be resolved with addition of metadata such as a code book that provides short descriptions or examples of what the category stands for. Fortunately, this can be improved in QGIS with the \u0026lsquo;Value Map\u0026rsquo; widget in Attributes Form. A drop down list of values can be created with their respective descriptions to be used in filling out attribute tables of maps.\nThis ensures a consistent data quality that is reproducible and minimises errors such as typos/using different words for the same category and also saves us time from typing each category individually!\nHistorical Maps These maps are useful in identifying culturally significant areas in the research area such as towns and specific cultivation lands. In our research area, a few areas we identified to be interesting from the given historical map were \u0026lsquo;De Meent\u0026rsquo;, the \u0026lsquo;Tabaks Plantage\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;Buitenwaarden\u0026rsquo; near the Rhenen municipality.\nDe Meent Although the area now consists of paved roads and a residential area, it used to be a common plot of land used by farmers in Medieval times with differences in soil conditions and height.\nIt was interesting to discover that an attempt at mapping places of heritage, archaeology and monuments has already been done by the Gementee Utrechtse Heuvelrug! Tabaks Plantage The region of Utrechtse Heuvelrug is also known to be the only region in the Netherlands where tobacco was planted, and this is reflected in the historical map showing the tobacco plantation. Although the land is now currently part of a forest.\nBuitenwaarden Originally a floodplain of the adjacent river Rhine channel, it is now a nature reserve. It is also part of the transition between the river and forest landscape.\nThere are a lot more areas in the map waiting to be explored, which can tell us a lot about the context of current and historical land use.\n","date":"2025-02-03T00:00:00Z","image":"http://localhost:4321/p/hello-world/ResearchArea_After_Classified_hu_694d3b4765336040.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/p/hello-world/","title":"Week 1 - Introduction to Predictive Modelling"},{"content":"\nDo you struggle in understanding how the landscape of the Netherlands came to be about today? Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you\u0026rsquo;re not alone.\nHaving to summarise and explain about the geology of the Netherlands in general over the span of thousands of years seem to be a daunting task, but it is easy to just think about the (somewhat recent) general geology of the Netherlands in two phases (there are other events that caused many other things to happen but we are not geologists and will not attempt to explain those):\nPleistocene Two glacials (ice age, very cold periods) happened during this time, namely the Saalien and Weichselian. The Weichselian came first but didn\u0026rsquo;t result in ice reaching the Netherlands. The Netherlands was just a very cold and dry desert with strong winds transporting cover sand (aeolian deposits) especially towards the south (present day Limburg) which also gave rise to the highly fertile loess (silt) there. During the Saalien glacial, the ice did reach the Netherlands and the glaciers pushed up and transported sediment which created ridges known as ice-push moraines such as the one found in Utrechtse Heuvelrug that is within our research area! Holocene Temperatures rose during the Holocene which resulted in the retreat of the glaciers from the ice age and rising sea levels. The Netherlands was flooded as a result which allowed peat formation and deposition of sediment through water (fluvial and marine deposits)\nHow is geology relevant in our archaeological research? The red areas have Pleistocene deposits on the surface which are well-covered by sediment (either by wind/water/peat etc.) and hence, archaeology is deemed to be better preserved in these areas. The northern part of our research area interestingly falls under the red region as well.\nOur research area also then proves to be an interesting case study because it consists of most of the geological features of the Netherlands to be studied. From a moraine plateau, flood plains, river basins, cover sand as well as peat. Understanding landscape features and the processes which they are formed allows us to better associate and predict archaeology with them.\n","date":"2025-02-15T00:00:00Z","image":"http://localhost:4321/p/geology-of-the-netherlands/images/pleistocene_nl_hu_3a99bc3bf1f0bfb6.png","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/p/geology-of-the-netherlands/","title":"Geology of the Netherlands"}]
